# Normal For Vanilla

Normal For Vanilla adds a 64x resolution normal to the existing vanilla texture.



## Description

I wanted to make a resource pack that anyone can use while giving simple textures.

This pack will be continuously updated.

When applying this pack, if your shader is Lab pbr, change it to Old pbr through settings or turn off AO maps.
This pack may be applied in an unintended way when using a Lab pbr that stores AO in Blue as the normal contains z in Blue.

To check whether the shader supports the pbr version and whether it supports AO maps, please refer [here](https://wiki.shaderlabs.org/wiki/LabPBR_Supported_Packs).



## Copyright

You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon page.
(This is the almost same condition as [Vanilla-Normal-Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed).)
